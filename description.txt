The provided Flutter code constitutes a multi-platform project designed for creating an adaptable and visually
appealing login interface. The project encompasses three distinct login screens: `LandscapeLogInScreen`,
`SquareLogInScreen`, and presumably a third screen tailored for portrait orientation. The Flutter framework,
coupled with the Dart programming language, is employed to construct these screens, ensuring cross-platform
compatibility.

The login screens feature interactive components such as email and password input fields, each equipped with
dynamic behaviors based on user actions. The password input field incorporates a visibility toggle, enabling
users to reveal or conceal their entered password. Notably, the code integrates a password strength indicator
that assesses and visually communicates the strength of the provided password.

The user interface is responsive, adjusting its layout to suit various device screen dimensions, thereby
delivering an optimal experience across diverse platforms. Animated transitions enhance the visual appeal and
user engagement of the login screens. In addition to standard login functionality, the screens include options
for logging in with Facebook, indicating a potential integration of Facebook authentication in the application.

In summary, this project is centered around the development of a versatile and visually polished login
interface for a multi-platform application. The inclusion of three screen variations, responsive design,
and interactive features, including a password strength indicator, underscores the commitment to creating a
robust and user-friendly authentication experience across different platforms.
