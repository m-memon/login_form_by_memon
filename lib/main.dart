//  This code serves as the entry point for a Flutter application. It imports
//  the necessary Flutter material package and a custom module (`my_app.dart`)
//  from the source directory. The `main` function initializes the Flutter
//  application by calling the `runApp` function with an instance of the `MyApp`
//  widget as an argument. This widget represents the root of the application's
//  widget tree, and the application's execution starts from here.
